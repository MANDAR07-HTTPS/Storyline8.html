            <h3><b><i>One of the critical accomplishments of Shivaji Maharaj was the conquest of Khandesh and Berar around the early 1670s, which enlarged the Maratha Empire and firmly established his hegemony over central India. With the capture of Khandesh, which lay between the Deccan and Gujarat and was of strategic importance, and Berar that was fertile and economically important, Shivaji Maharaj struck at the root of Mughal hegemony and acquired primary resources and trade routes. Each of these victories demonstrated Shivaji's strength and brilliance in strategy, hence pushing forward the territorial expanse of the Maratha Empire and its prestige accordingly. These successful campaigns to Khandesh and Berar brought about not only the consolidation of Maratha power but also an example of Shivaji Maharaj's ability to challenge and undermine the Mughal influence in the region.</i></b></h3>
